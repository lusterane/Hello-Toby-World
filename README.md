# Hello-Toby-World

Portfolio web site

## Status
âœ… Website is online and hosted at http://hellotobyworld.com

## Backend Features to add
* Cron scheduled updates that pull data from MySQL Database
  * DB will call from GitHub API to fetch my project info
* Develop API to communicate to database

## Notes
This is my first fully-developed web application and it is something I am absolutely loving so far. I've been building it all the way from the ground-up so that means no templates or referencing from other people's work. I think it's coming together to be a great website so I'd appreciate it if you would give it a look :^) 

### Your Criticism is appreciated!
I am still relatively knew to many of the technologies I'm currently using so if you have any tips or critisisms regarding the project, please do feel free to shoot me an email.

Have a nice day!
